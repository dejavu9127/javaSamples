1.

Create two different threads , First thread  by extending Thread class (set name -> "OddNo")
will print first 20 odd numbers and 
second thread  by implementing Runnable interface (set name -> "EvenNo") 
will print first 20 even numbers. 

Start the execution of both the threads and check the output.

Set minimum priority for first thread and  maximum priority for second. Test the output of two threads.

Use join method to terminate the main thread at the end.

check the output.

Use sleep method. 

Change the name of main thread as "MyMainThread".
Print the name and priority of each thread.

check the output.

2. Create a class Table with method printTable(int n) , which will accept int n as a parameter
   and will print its table.
   Create another class Caller which will extend Thread. This class has a reference 
   of Table class and int n.
   Use param. constructor to initialize objects.
   Override run method and in that call printTable().
   Create two thread objects in main using Caller class. And start the execution. see the o/p.
	Now synchronize printTable() and again see the output.
	Call printTable() from synchronized block and see the output.
	Now make printTable() method as a static synchronized method and check the output again.
